# producer-consumer
Micro-benchmarks for various forms of producer/consumer strategies in clojure. Allows you to push X number of integers across thread boundaries and report the time taken.

Current results for 1_000_000 integers on my macbook using 1 producer && 1 consumer:
Lockless Ring Buffer(clj-ring-buffer): 3 seconds
STM with Clojure Persistent Queue:     8 seconds 
Java NIO Pipes:                        60 seconds * 

* much of this is probably from marshalling/unmarshalling to the required ByteBuffer intermediate form, but as this is a nescessary step(unless you do not need to manipulate POJO's), 
I still maintain it is a performance limitation.

## Usage

Just open up a namespace, and eval the (run-simulation *producer* *consumer* 1000000) form in the comments block.
