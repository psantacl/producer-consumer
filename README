# producer-consumer
Micro-benchmarks for various forms of producer/consumer strategies in clojure. Allows you to push X number of integers across thread boundaries and report the time taken.

Current results for 1_000_000 integers on my macbook:
STM with Clojure Persistent Queue:     8 seconds 
Lockless Ring Buffer(clj-ring-buffer): 30 seconds
Java NIO Pipes:                        60 seconds  -- much of this is probably from marshalling/unmarshalling to the required ByteBuffer intermediate form, but still...

## Usage

Just open up a namespace, and eval the (run-simulation *producer* *consumer* 1000000) form in the comments block.
