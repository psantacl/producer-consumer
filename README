# producer-consumer
Micro-benchmarks for various forms of producer/consumer strategies in clojure. Allows you push X number of integers through the system and reports the time taken.

Current results for 1_000_000 integers on my macbook:
STM with Clojure Persistent Queue: 8 seconds 
Lockless Ring Buffer(clj-ring-buffer): 30 seconds
Java NIO Pipes: 60 seconds

## Usage

Just open up a namespace, and eval the (run-simulation *producer* *consumer* 1000000) form in the comments block.
